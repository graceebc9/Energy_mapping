# UK Energy Density Mapping Project

## Overview
The UK Energy Density Mapping Project aims to analyze and visualize the energy density across different postcodes in the UK. By leveraging publicly available data sources, including census information, demographic data, and remotely sensed imagery, this project seeks to uncover patterns and insights into energy usage and distribution. The goal is to provide stakeholders, policymakers, and the public with actionable insights to drive energy efficiency and sustainability efforts.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Integration:** Combine data from various sources, including the UK postcode electricity and gas data, census, demographic datasets, and satellite imagery, to create a comprehensive view of energy distribution.
- **Energy Density Analysis:** Calculate and analyze the energy density (energy usage per unit area, energy usage per m^3 residential building volume) across different postcodes to identify high and low-efficiency areas.
- **Visualization:** Develop interactive maps and visualizations that clearly represent the energy density, enabling easy interpretation and analysis.
- **Insight Generation:** Provide insights into patterns of energy usage, potential areas for efficiency improvements, and the impact of demographic factors on energy consumption.

## Data Sources
This project utilizes the following publicly available data sources:
- **UK Gas and Electricity Data:** Postcode level energy usage from DESNEZ
- **UK Census Data:** Provides detailed demographic information at the postcode level.
- **Remote Sensing Imagery:** Satellite images to assess geographical and infrastructural factors influencing energy usage.
- **UK Building stock:** Verisk building data via Edina Digimap
